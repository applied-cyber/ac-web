## Notes

* Due to some recent changes to the Stanford Slack workspace, you can now only sign up automatically using an `@stanford.edu`, `@cs.stanford.edu` or `@alumni.stanford.edu` email address. If you don't have an email address following either of those two formats, please email soe_applied-cyber@stanford.edu with your Stanford email address, and we will add you to the Slack.
* Unfortunately, we aren’t able to add non-Stanford affiliates to the Slack at this time. However, feel free to join the applied-cybersecurity@lists.stanford.edu mailing list, where we’ll be advertising any external events related to Applied Cyber and occasional club announcements.
