### Low Cost Drones & Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in Warfare

*Friday, October 28, 2022 at 3:30pm* \
*Y2E2 300*

Low cost (sub $20K) drones are disrupting how modern warfare is conducted. At the same time, crowd sourced OSINT (open source intelligence) from real-time Internet feeds like Twitter and TikTok are dramatically shortening the loop for situational awareness on the battlefield. In this talk Alex Keller will provide a survey of these emerging trends with curated examples from social media.

**CONTENT WARNING**: This presentation will include screenshots and video of warfare that may be disturbing. While there will be no images of deceased or injured people, the subject matter is unavoidably grave.
