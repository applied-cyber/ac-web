Starting with my personal experiences in hacking smart vehicles, financial institutions and government infrastructure, I tell some stories that are partly humorous, partly shocking. From there, I go over to the topic of critical infrastructure and development towards a "cyber-physical" world including the associated risks. Then I will shed light on the upcoming threats from a hacker's perspective, briefly talking about cloud and API technologies, but especially the topic of software supply chain (SDLC) and the effects of artificial intelligence. In conclusion, I discuss the current shortage of skilled workers and share a common outlook on the future.

Today, more than 85% of endpoint usage time is on the browser. Yet, most organizations still rely on domain-based web filtering technologies such as SWGs/SASEs developed nearly two decades ago. Attackers have exploited this fact and developed increasingly complex attacks targeting users on the web. At DEFCON 32 this year, SquareX did four talks where they disclosed multiple advanced client side web attacks that completely bypass all major SWGs. Vivek will be conducting a workshop on two of these major attack classes:

* **Last Mile Reassembly Attacks** - malicious payloads can be delivered through unmonitored channels (webRTC, gRPC, etc.), disguised as code/images, chunked/encrypted files or encoding techniques, among others, before being reassembled into a malicious file at the client site.

* **Malicious Browser Extensions** - advanced attacks delivered through browser extensions including content script injections and remote code execution, DOM manipulation to invoke executable downloads, cookie session hijacking, webcam feed stealing and GitHub account hijacking.

Vivek will be presenting demos of how some of these attacks occur in real environments, how one would go about building these attacks and defenses against them.

Vivek Ramachandran is a security researcher, book author, speaker-trainer, and serial entrepreneur with over two decades of experience in offensive cybersecurity. He is currently the founder of SquareX, a Sequoia backed browser security company. Prior to that, he found and led Pentester Academy (acquired in 2021), where he trained the pentest & red teams of many Fortune500 companies and government institutions such as the Pentagon and DoD.
As a security researcher, Vivek discovered the Caffe Latte attack, broke WEP Cloaking, conceptualized enterprise Wi-Fi Backdoors, and created Chellam (Wi-Fi Firewall), WiMonitor Enterprise (802.11ac monitoring), Chigula (Wi-Fi traffic analysis via SQL), Deceptacon (IoT Honeypots), among others and has been a speaker at BlackHat & Defcon since 2007. He is also currently part of the BlackHat Arsenal Review Board.

Audrey Adeline works closely with Vivek as part of the Founder's Office and leads most key strategic initiatives for SquareX. Previously, she was part of the investment team at Sequoia that led SquareX's seed round, where she specialized in cybersecurity and software investments.

Shourya Pratap Singh is a Principal Software Engineer at SquareX and is responsible for building SquareX's security-focused extension and led multiple research pieces on browser extension based attacks. He has presented his innovative security research at Defcon, the Texas Cyber Summit and Blackhat Arsenal EU.
