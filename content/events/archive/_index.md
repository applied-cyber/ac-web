### Firebase: Insecure by Default

*Friday, February 18, 2022 at 5:00pm* \
*Shriram SB33*

Firebase is an easy-to-use database implementation widely used by new app developers and up-and-coming startup MVPs. If you walk through a hackathon, odds are everyone is using Firebase. This holds true for Stanford’s undergraduate startup culture. We have found the vast majority of these Stanford focused mini-startups use Firebase. This includes Queer Chart, Buzz, Lighthouse, and many more!

Yet Firebase databases are incredibly difficult to properly implement. This is because most Firebase databases directly communicate with the app — thus allowing the end user to directly interact with the database. While this can be mitigated using strong user control rules, this is done inadequately (or not at all) in practice — leaving most Firebase implementations dangerously insecure, by default.

During this Friday’s talk, Aditya Saligrama and Miles McCain will take us through Firebase insecurity, showing us examples from an app widely used by Stanford students that had critical vulnerabilities due to badly configured Firebase. This story has it all — drama, suspense, and expert hacking.  This is a talk you do not want to miss!

### Mechanics of Exploiting Log4j

*Friday, February 4, 2022 at 5:00pm* \
*Shriram SB33*

The recent Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-4428 et al) are arguably the most serious threat since the NSA lost control of Eternal Blue. This Java logging library is vastly deployed within both commercial and open source software - affording a massive attack surface. But there’s a twist, the remote attack vector involves sending a malicious text string to a network service that then passes it to Log4j where it is acted up to make a special lookup that eventually results in the execution of a payload.

So if this vulnerability is so severe, why haven’t we seen mass compromises yet? In part this is because the attack is indirect, where successful exploitation differs based on the exposed  service and preconditions of the application stack. Reliable attack tools take time to develop and their capabilities are initially constrained if the attack surface has high diversity with nuanced permutations that render exploitation a matter of “it depends”.
