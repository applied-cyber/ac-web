### Firebase: Insecure by Default

*Friday, February 18, 2022 at 5:00pm* \
*Shriram SB33*

Firebase is an easy-to-use database implementation widely used by new app developers and up-and-coming startup MVPs. If you walk through a hackathon, odds are everyone is using Firebase. This holds true for Stanford’s undergraduate startup culture. We have found the vast majority of these Stanford focused mini-startups use Firebase. This includes Queer Chart, Buzz, Lighthouse, and many more!

Yet Firebase databases are incredibly difficult to properly implement. This is because most Firebase databases directly communicate with the app — thus allowing the end user to directly interact with the database. While this can be mitigated using strong user control rules, this is done inadequately (or not at all) in practice — leaving most Firebase implementations dangerously insecure, by default.

During this Friday’s talk, Aditya Saligrama and Miles McCain will take us through Firebase insecurity, showing us examples from an app widely used by Stanford students that had critical vulnerabilities due to badly configured Firebase. This story has it all — drama, suspense, and expert hacking.  This is a talk you do not want to miss!

### Mechanics of Exploiting Log4j

*Friday, February 4, 2022 at 5:00pm* \
*Shriram SB33*

The recent Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-4428 et al) are arguably the most serious threat since the NSA lost control of Eternal Blue. This Java logging library is vastly deployed within both commercial and open source software - affording a massive attack surface. But there’s a twist, the remote attack vector involves sending a malicious text string to a network service that then passes it to Log4j where it is acted up to make a special lookup that eventually results in the execution of a payload.

So if this vulnerability is so severe, why haven’t we seen mass compromises yet? In part this is because the attack is indirect, where successful exploitation differs based on the exposed  service and preconditions of the application stack. Reliable attack tools take time to develop and their capabilities are initially constrained if the attack surface has high diversity with nuanced permutations that render exploitation a matter of “it depends”.

### Math, Motion, and Machine Learning: Implicit Authentication in the Real World

*Tusday, December 3, 2019 at 6:00pm* \
*Gates 174*

How do you identify people? What is it that makes you, you? Certain aspects of human behavior can be as unique and as hard to spoof as a fingerprint. The way you walk, the way you move, the places you go, and your little idiosyncrasies have the promise of being more convenient and more secure than other forms of authentication like passwords or biometrics. But there are significant practical challenges in building a system that can authenticate you to >99% accuracy with just a few seconds of passive sensor readings while still maintaining user privacy. It requires lots of advanced math, signal processing, machine learning, tricky engineering, and re-thinking existing security paradigms.

Come hear about our experience in building such a platform and a glimpse into the future of authentication.

### A Thousand Ways To Track You on The Web, And How To Start To Protect Yourself

*Thursday, November 21, 2019 at 6:00pm* \
*Gates 174*

Without protection, users on the web are tracked on nearly every site they visit, by parties familiar and unknown alike. This talk will give some background to how tracking became so rampant on the web, along with why it should be a cause for concern to everyone. The majority of the talk will then discuss how web users are tracked, using methods ranging from dead simple too sophisticated and complex. We’ll spend some time thinking through counter measures, both deployed and theoretical, including a comparison of existing popular blocking tools. Finally, we’ll discuss some possible, planned future defenses.By the end of the talk, attendees should have a much better understanding of the scale of the tracking problem, along with which tracking methods we have solutions to, and which the privacy community still needs to address.This will be an informal presentation, with an emphasis on discussion and working through problems together.

### Leveraging Apple’s Game Engine to Heuristically Detect macOS Threats

*Thursday, March 7, 2019 at 3:00pm* \
*Spilker 317*

By examining recent exploits and malware attacks, we'll illustrate that macOS is a rather vulnerable and an ever more targeted OS. And unfortunately for Mac users, traditional signature-based approaches often fail to detect such threats. Instead a heuristic-based, behavioral approach is clearly needed. In this talk, we will discuss a new open-source monitoring framework which passively collects a myriad of system events. Building on top of this, we will then detail a predicate-based system that leverages Apple’s game (logic) engine to quickly and efficiently apply rules against these events. End result? A comprehensive detection, response and threat hunting platform.
