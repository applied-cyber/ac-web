Become a digital detective at this week’s Applied Cyber workshop! Come learn all about OSINT (Open Source INTelligence), which is the art of using publicly available data to generate useful information. OSINT is used for penetration testing, business, research, investigative journalism, and much more. We’ll first take a look at a viral example of OSINT focusing on geolocation, and then explore a variety of other common techniques before giving you a chance to try them all out on your own!

IoT (Internet of Things) devices are a staple of the modern world. But, as common as they are, they can be surprisingly easy to hack. In this workshop, we'll explore the basics of Bluetooth LE (low energy) hacking by using your computer to take control of popular smart devices. We will use an open source software called Bleak to scan for, connect to, and send instructions to these insecure devices.

Memory safety vulnerabilities like use-after-free and buffer overflows account for a huge portion of security vulnerabilities. The best defense against memory safety issues is to use a language that doesn't have them. Rust is a blazingly fast memory safe language with a rich type system that eliminates entire classes of bugs. It's a joy to work with, and you should consider writing your next project in Rust!

### Security Advances in Software-Defined Networking

The tenets of Software Defined Networking have completely shifted the traditional paradigm of networking. No longer do individual network devices need to independently compute routes or manage traffic signaling. Instead, through the magic of SDN, the control plane for each device is decoupled from the data plane and centralized across the network. This reduces overall workload for individual devices and allows greater CPU allocation for data plane tasks, reducing latency. In relation to security, SDN reimagines networks through concepts of virtual network segmentation, allowing administrators to gain granular control over network clients and applications. Along with centralized network visibility, user profiling and posture assessment, faster incident response times and so much more, SDN is revolutionizing networks and security across the world.
