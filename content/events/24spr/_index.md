### Cross-Language Vulnerabilities

*Friday, April 19, 2024 at 4:30pm* \
*Y2E2 362*

Memory corruption attacks have long plagued computer systems that use unsafe programming languages like C/C++. To enhance the security of these systems, developers have gradually introduced memory-safe languages like Rust to existing codebases, an approach that is effective but not foolproof. This talk will delve into the ways in which attackers can carefully manoeuvre between safe and unsafe code to undermine the security of mixed-language applications.
