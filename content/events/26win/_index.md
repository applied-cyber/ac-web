### From Logs to Language: Using Encoder-Decoder Architectures to Translate Cyber Threats

*Friday, February 20, 2026 at 4:30pm* \
*Shriram 108*

Join us for a deep dive into how modern ML architectures can turn noisy security telemetry into clear, human-readable threat narratives with Josiah Lashley, founding AI engineer at DeepTempo. Josiah will walk through an encoder–decoder style approach where the encoder learns structured representations of attacker behavior from high-volume data (e.g., netflow, WAF logs, cloud events) and the decoder translates those representations into investigative context—timelines, explanations, and stories SOC teams can act on.

### :honey_pot: Honeypot Dreams & Stranger Things :bee:

*Friday, January 23, 2026 at 4:30pm* \
*Shriram 108*

This presentation shares the hands-on experience of a cohort from the Stanford IT Experiential Development Program in deploying and operating honeypots using open-source infrastructure and software. We will walk through the operational decisions involved -- including design, tooling, and security considerations. This session will also highlight attacker behaviors observed in the wild, including the techniques and motivations of the adversaries. Attendees will have a chance to attack the honeypots during the session.

### Reversing Everything with Claude Code

*Friday, January 16, 2026 at 4:30pm* \
*Shriram 108*

Everything you touch is a black box... until you make it talk. In this session, Zane shows how *Claude Code* turns "reverse engineering" from a grind into a fast and furious workflow: capture a little evidence, ask the right questions, and let an AI agent do the tedious digging while you steer the investigation responsibly. We will tour real-world targets across the difficulty spectrum:

- Sniffing and decoding campus washing-machine telemetry.
- Extracting an undocumented Fire TV control protocol into clean API docs and a working Python library.
- Battling a Bluetooth-only pocket printer with an ESP32 proxy.
- Off the deep end with a suspicious Android projector firmware and a hunt for embedded malware.

Expect practical demos, honest caveats (hallucinations happen), and a playbook for using agentic tools - checklists, narrow scopes, and parallel strategies - to reverse “everything”.
