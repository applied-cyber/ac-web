### Reversing Everything with Claude Code

*Friday, January 16, 2026 at 4:30pm* \
*Shriram 108*

Everything you touch is a black box... until you make it talk. In this session, Zane shows how *Claude Code* turns "reverse engineering" from a grind into a fast and furious workflow: capture a little evidence, ask the right questions, and let an AI agent do the tedious digging while you steer the investigation responsibly. We will tour real-world targets across the difficulty spectrum:

- Sniffing and decoding campus washing-machine telemetry.
- Extracting an undocumented Fire TV control protocol into clean API docs and a working Python library.
- Battling a Bluetooth-only pocket printer with an ESP32 proxy.
- Off the deep end with a suspicious Android projector firmware and a hunt for embedded malware.

Expect practical demos, honest caveats (hallucinations happen), and a playbook for using agentic tools - checklists, narrow scopes, and parallel strategies - to reverse “everything”.
