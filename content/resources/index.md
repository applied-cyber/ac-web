This page contains links to helpful or educational resources relating to the club or cybersecurity in general. Here you can find links to code and projects maintained by the club, as well as any general resources helpful for learning about computer security.

## Club resources

* Our [GitHub](https://github.com/applied-cyber) hosts public code for projects and competitions. Any contributions are welcome!
* Join our [Slack](https://appliedcybersecurity.slack.com) to discuss club events and computer security in general!

### Development

Some things we've built that you might find useful:

* [CCDC tooling](https://github.com/applied-cyber/ccdc): some packages and scripts we use in competition in CCDC
    - [Network killer](https://github.com/aesrentai/network_killer): a Rust tool to kill all established TCP connections on a Linux machine
    - [Ansible hardening toolkit](https://github.com/aesrentai/ansible_hardening_toolkit)
* [CatShare](https://github.com/saligrama/catshare-serverless): a cat-themed vulnerable website featuring IDOR, XSS, and session handling vulnerabilities
* [Securescope](https://github.com/saligrama/securescope): an autograder base Docker image for Gradescope with improved security

### Security courses at Stanford

* \* INTLPOL 268 *Hack Lab: Introduction to Cybersecurity* (typically fall) is an introductory cyber security, law, and policy course. Hack Lab teaches the basics of a number of different types of security exploits, including web attacks and defenses, operating system attacks such as EternalBlue, Firebase, and phishing and social engineering, as well as the legal ramifications of such attacks. There are no prerequisites and no computer science background assumed.
* \* [CS 155](https://cs155.stanford.edu) *Computer and Network Security* (typically spring) is the main, more technically involved security course at Stanford. The three main components of the course are memory safety and control hijacking, web attacks and defenses, and network security. The prerequisite is an operating systems class such as CS111.
* \* [CS 153](https://cs153.stanford.edu) *Applied Security at Scale* is a course that deals with the unique challenges of solving security problems at industry scale and brings a number of renowned guest speakers to campus. Past speakers have included Matthew Prince (CEO of Cloudflare), Steve Huffman (CEO of Reddit), and Greg Brockman (cofounder of OpenAI).
* \* [CS 255](https://cs255.stanford.edu) *Introduction to Cryptography* (typically winter) covers the theory and practice of modern cryptographic techniques for computer security, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, authentication, and key management. The prerequisite is an introductory probability class such as CS109.
* \* [CS 40](https://infracourse.cloud) *Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment* (typically winter) is a student-taught course on deploying web applications to the cloud in an efficient way that can scale to large user growth at minimal cost, with a significant emphasis on security. The prerequisite is an introductory systems class such as CS107.
* [CS 152](https://cs152.stanford.edu) *Trust and Safety Engineering* can be thought of as the flipside of digital security: it handles the ways that online services can cause harm when used as intended (whereas security generally deals with abuse of services in ways originally unintended). The prerequisite is a secondary CS class such as CS106B.
* \* [CS 144](https://cs144.stanford.edu) *Introduction to Computer Networking* covers foundational computer networking topics including internet and transport protocols and routing and frequently touches on security topics. The prerequisite is an operating systems class such as CS111.
* [CS 249I](https://cs249i.stanford.edu) *The Modern Internet* (typically winter) is an exploration of how the internet operates in practice today, heavily touching on modern internet security concepts such as TLS and WebPKI, as well as the security of BGP, DNS, and email systems. This is an advanced networking course that has an introductory networking course such as CS144 as a prerequisite.
* [CS 356](https://cs356.stanford.edu) *Topics in Computer and Network Security* is a graduate research-oriented course that covers foundational and evolving topics in the security field. The prerequisite is a foundational security course such as CS155.
