The [Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](https://nationalccdc.org) is a blue team competition that gives students insight into what real-world attacks are like and how to defend against them. In CCDC, each team of eight must defend a company network against attacks from a professional red team and maintain the availability of services such as web sites, mail servers, and DNS.

Each team is given the same initial configuration, which typically includes an even mix of Linux and Windows machines. In addition to securing the initial network, competitors complete tasks such as setting up new services, performing vulnerability assessment, or providing documentation of company security policies.

Applied Cyber competes in the [Western Region](https://wrccdc.org) for CCDC, which organizes Invitational events from November through January, Qualifiers in February, and Regional Finals held in Anaheim in March or April. The top team from the Western Regional Finals advances to the National Finals, held in Texas in late April.

## Who can participate?

The Invitational events are open to anyone and there is no limit on the number of people who can compete. The Invitationals take place in a virtualized environment and we compete from Stanford campus.

For all other events, up to 8 team members from the school roster may compete. The team roster can have up to 12 members and at most two of these can be graduate students.
