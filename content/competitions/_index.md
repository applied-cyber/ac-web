Our student teams participate in competitions involving offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) skills. We host our own lab environment consisting of several virtual machine hypervisors and dozens of virtual machines for training. This allows us to practice a wide variety of skills that are not usually presented in classes.

Since shortly after its founding in 2015, Applied Cyber has participated in the [Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](https://nationalccdc.org) (CCDC) and [Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition](https://cp.tc) (CPTC) every year. Most recently, we placed 1st at National CCDC in 2023 and 2nd at CPTC Global Finals in 2024.
