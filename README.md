# Stanford Security Clinic website

This repository contains the source code for the [Stanford Applied Cyber website](https://applied-cyber.stanford.edu/), which is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Development

To run the website locally, you will need to install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Once you have Hugo installed, you can run the following command to start a local server:

```bash
hugo serve
```

In another terminal window, you will need to run `npm run watch-tw` to rebuild the Tailwind CSS files as you make changes.
